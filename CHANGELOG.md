# Changelog

## 1.7.0

### New Features

**Custom markdown builders** (closes #10)

Expose `gpt_markdown`'s builder callbacks so you can customize how images, links, code blocks, and more are rendered inside streaming text.

* `imageBuilder` — custom widget for markdown images
* `onLinkTap` — callback when a link is tapped
* `codeBuilder` — custom widget for code blocks
* `latexBuilder` — custom widget for LaTeX expressions
* `sourceTagBuilder` — custom widget for source tags
* `highlightBuilder` — custom widget for highlighted text
* `linkBuilder` — custom widget for links

All parameters are optional and available on every constructor including `.chatGPT()`, `.claude()`, `.typewriter()`, `.instant()`, and `.fromPreset()`.

```dart
StreamingTextMarkdown.chatGPT(
  text: response,
  markdownEnabled: true,
  imageBuilder: (context, url) => CachedNetworkImage(imageUrl: url),
  onLinkTap: (url, title) => launchUrl(Uri.parse(url)),
  codeBuilder: (context, name, code, closed) => MyCodeBlock(code: code),
);
```

**Trailing fade effect** — new `trailingFadeEnabled` parameter

Optional trailing gradient fade at the bottom edge while text is streaming. The fade holds steady during streaming and smoothly animates away when complete. Opt-in via `trailingFadeEnabled: true` — disabled by default.

### Bug Fixes

* **Fix emoji character skipping during animation resume** (closes PR #9) — `_displayedText.length` returned UTF-16 code units but was used as an index into grapheme cluster lists, causing characters after emoji to be dropped. Now uses `_displayedText.characters.length`.
* **Fix Arabic/RTL word splitting** — the previous regex stripped Arabic punctuation and hamza (ء) as delimiters and didn't preserve markdown syntax (headers, blockquotes, lists). Now uses the same markdown-aware splitting as LTR text.
* **Fix trailing fade blinking** — the trailing gradient was resetting on every animation tick, causing visible flashing. Now holds steady during streaming and animates away once on completion.
* **Fix setState during build in example** — `StreamingTextController` callbacks in the example's ControllerSection could fire during the build phase. Deferred with `addPostFrameCallback`.

## 1.6.0

### ✨ New Features

**Shimmer loading state — `isLoading` parameter**

Show an animated skeleton placeholder while waiting for the first LLM token (TTFT).
No more blank screen between sending a request and the first character appearing.

* **`isLoading: false`** — New parameter on all constructors and named variants. When `true`, displays an animated shimmer skeleton instead of the text widget. Defaults to `false` — all existing code is completely unaffected.
* **`shimmerLineCount: 3`** — Controls how many skeleton lines are shown. Defaults to 3.
* **Pure Flutter implementation** — No external shimmer package. Uses `AnimationController` + `LinearGradient` sweep. Adapts to light/dark theme automatically.
* **Markdown tables confirmed** — gpt_markdown renders tables natively. Added documentation and example.

```dart
// Usage example
StreamingTextMarkdown.chatGPT(
  text: _accumulatedText,
  isLoading: _waitingForFirstToken,  // true until first token, then false
)
```

### 🔧 Improvements

* Upgraded `gpt_markdown` dependency to `^1.1.6` — picks up table column alignment fix, ordered list bug fix, Flutter 3.35 compatibility, and heading style customization fixes

## 1.5.0

### ✨ New Features

**Trailing-edge fade animation for markdown and RTL content**

Previously, `fadeInEnabled: true` only worked with plain text (`markdownEnabled: false`). This release brings smooth streaming animations to all content types.

* **Markdown fade-in** — When `fadeInEnabled: true` and `markdownEnabled: true`, a trailing-edge gradient fade animates at the bottom of the content as new text streams in, using the configured `fadeInCurve` and `fadeInDuration`
* **RTL/Arabic support** — Fade animations now work correctly with Arabic and Hebrew text (previously disabled for RTL languages)
* **Block LaTeX protection** — When streaming inside a `$$...$$` block, uses a gentle opacity pulse instead of gradient mask to avoid visually cutting through equations
* **Revolutionary example page** — Complete showcase redesign with all 17 package features: named constructors, 9 presets, full controller API, markdown, LaTeX, RTL, theme system, live customization playground, and GitHub Pages deployment
* **GitHub Pages live demo** — https://hooshyar.github.io/flutter_streaming_text_markdown/

### 🔧 Improvements

* Example page rebuilt from scratch: 11 files, 1300+ lines, dark/light mode, responsive
* All links in example are now clickable (pub.dev, GitHub, License)
* Preset grid shows all 9 `LLMAnimationPresets` with live mini-previews
* Controller section demonstrates full `StreamingTextController` API with progress bar, state display, speed multiplier
* Added pub.dev badge count in hero section

### ✅ Compatibility

Fully backward compatible — existing code unchanged. Fade-in for markdown only activates when both `fadeInEnabled: true` AND `markdownEnabled: true` are set.

## 1.4.0

### ✨ New Features

**This release adds a dedicated `markdownStyleSheet` property (typed as `TextStyle`) while maintaining 100% backward compatibility. Includes all v1.3.3 stability fixes.**

* **Dedicated Markdown Style Property** - Cleaner API for markdown styling (Fixes Issue #5)
  - NEW: `StreamingTextTheme.markdownStyleSheet` property accepts `TextStyle`
  - NEW: `StreamingTextMarkdown.styleSheet` now properly typed as `TextStyle?`
  - Uses `gpt_markdown` package for proper markdown rendering
  - Example:
    ```dart
    StreamingTextTheme(
      markdownStyleSheet: TextStyle(
        fontSize: 16,
        fontWeight: FontWeight.w400,
        color: Colors.black87,
      ),
    )
    ```

### 🔄 Backward Compatibility

* **Zero Breaking Changes** ✓
  - `StreamingTextTheme.markdownStyle` still works (deprecated with migration path)
  - Old code using `markdownStyle: TextStyle()` continues to work perfectly
  - New code can use `markdownStyleSheet` for a clearer API
  - Migration timeline: v1.4.0 (add markdownStyleSheet) → v2.0.0 (remove markdownStyle)

### 📚 Documentation Alignment

* **Fixed Documentation Mismatch** - Code now matches README examples
  - README examples now accurately show `TextStyle` usage
  - API documentation updated to reflect actual types
  - Closes Issue #5 opened Oct 16, 2025

### 🔧 Migration Guide

**No migration required!** Old code continues to work:

```dart
// Old way (still works, deprecated)
StreamingTextTheme(
  markdownStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
)

// New way (recommended)
StreamingTextTheme(
  markdownStyleSheet: TextStyle(
    fontSize: 16,
    fontWeight: FontWeight.w400,
    color: Colors.black87,
  ),
)
```

### 🛡️ Includes All v1.3.3 Stability Fixes

* Fixed timer memory leaks (better long-running app performance)
* Fixed AnimationController disposal errors
* Fixed stream double-wrapping issues
* 500x faster RTL/Arabic text processing

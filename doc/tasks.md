# Flutter Streaming Text Markdown - Tasks and Improvements

## Prioritized Tasks

### High Priority
1. **Accessibility Improvements**
   - Add screen reader support with semantics
   - Implement pause/resume functionality for animations
   - Add ARIA labels and descriptions

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Profile and optimize rendering for large text blocks
   - Reduce memory footprint for complex animations
   - Implement virtualized rendering for very long text

3. **Customization Enhancements**
   - Add support for custom animations (bounce, slide, etc.)
   - Allow dynamic speed changes during animation
   - Create built-in preset themes

### Medium Priority
4. **Testing and Stability**
   - Increase test coverage, especially for edge cases
   - Add integration tests with example app
   - Test with different Flutter versions for compatibility

5. **Feature Additions**
   - Add support for code blocks with syntax highlighting
   - Implement animated list items and custom bullet points
   - Add typographic effects (rainbow text, shadows, etc.)

6. **Documentation**
   - Create interactive demo website
   - Add video tutorials
   - Improve API documentation with more examples

### Lower Priority
7. **Integration Support**
   - Add native integration with Firebase for real-time streaming
   - Create adapters for popular chat APIs
   - Implement StreamProvider for OpenAI/Anthropic completions

8. **Platform-specific Optimizations**
   - Optimize animations for web
   - Ensure consistent behavior across platforms
   - Add platform-specific rendering options

## Implementation Notes

### Accessibility Implementation
```dart
// Proposed implementation for screen reader support
class AccessibleStreamingText extends StatefulWidget {
  // Implementation details
}
```

### Performance Improvements
- Use RepaintBoundary for optimized rendering
- Implement custom TextPainter for better control
- Memoize rendered segments to avoid recomputation

### Extended Features Planning
1. Advanced animation effects
   - Sequential reveals (paragraph by paragraph)
   - Multi-color gradients for text
   - Mixed animation speeds within same text

2. Interactive elements
   - Clickable links with custom actions
   - Animated code editor with execution capability
   - Interactive diagrams within markdown
